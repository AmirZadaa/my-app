      <p>JavaScript, commonly known as JS, is a versatile, high-level programming language that has become a core component of web development. Created initially as a client-side scripting language for web browsers, it enables dynamic and interactive elements on webpages, such as animations, pop-up messages, and form validations. Over time, JavaScript has evolved and expanded beyond just the browser. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used server-side, making it a full-stack language. Its asynchronous nature, achieved through callback functions, promises, and async/await syntax, allows for non-blocking operations, making it ideal for handling high-volume data processing, network requests, and other I/O tasks. </p>
